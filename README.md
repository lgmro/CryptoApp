# CryptoApp
I develop this app together: Philipp Lackner (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF33KmyprEQ), to tranning creating layouts with Jetpack Compose.
This app has three branches: 
 - Main: Contain the more stable version of the app;
 - Develop: Branch  used to develop the app;
 - usingDIKoin: The same project, but using Koin (https://insert-koin.io/) to inject the dependency (just to learn how to use together Jetpack Compose).

In this project, I also tranning clean architecture, a good way to keep your app scalable. I also used MVVM pattern
